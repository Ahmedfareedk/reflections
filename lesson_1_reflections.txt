How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

well, it saves much time!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
it makes me work with no worries of any troubles I'd have with the current version, so I can get back to the older ones.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-- it won't get my history too big and too hard to read and compare. However, I may forgete to commit a logical change in my project.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-- because those all files are related to the same project and they dependent on each other.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-- git log shows number of commits as well as its messages of each, whereas, git diff shows the differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
--I am gonna have fears of editing my code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I wanna use it with Github
